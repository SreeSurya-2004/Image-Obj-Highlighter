# Image-Obj-Highlighter
This project is to develop a system where the user uploads an image, the system detects all objects in the image using a pre-trained deep learning model (Detectron2), displays a list of detected objects, and allows the user to select one of them to highlight. The highlighted result is saved and displayed as the output.
